# Ballistic trajectories within the atmosphere

## Overview

Developed for Unusual systems and in collaboration with Lancaster laboratories, this script performs a simple simulation of an unpowered ballistic projectile within the Earths atmosphere. The simulation uses the Velocity Verlet method to simulate the projectiles motion and applies it with a simple atmosphere model [made available by NASA](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/atmosmet.html).
